# Describe and document your code here
Previously we installed and ran Ollama. We chose the model llama 3.2. The running was succesfull (the prompt works).

We started to use Google Colab and connected a GPU there. 
Then we were trying to modify the code, but we had troubles with it. Here is our attempt or just beginning: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1DTkn8v-nB66B6adZHfv4skkdBbUKN7Sn?usp=sharing. 

I have just added file with the last version of our code.
